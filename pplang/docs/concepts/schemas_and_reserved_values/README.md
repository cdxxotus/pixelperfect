# Intro

When interpreting value, pplang can take it as it, or as schema


## Schemas

They are interpreted by pplang as a set of instruction to retrieve the expected output.

Operators and compilers can face such a situation. They are free to customize their interpretation of a schema.

pplang compiler actually excel at turning regular objects into schema that can be interpreted with extreme granularity.

The pplang/hard/reserved file contains unicode characters that are tied to the own existence of the schema.
